product ratings to help users make informed decisions.

and proceed to checkout.

experience by keeping preferred items accessible.

transactions and reorder favourite products.

Expectations
For our online shopping app, we aim to make the user interface intuitive, so that 
everyone from advanced users to those less familiar with digital apps can navigate it 
easily. This includes having a responsive design that works well on both phones and 
tablets.
We expect the app to be fast and easy to use, with features like item searches, wish 
lists, and viewing purchase histories working smoothly even when many users are 
online. 
We anticipate that features like the search function, wish list, and viewing product 
details will enhance user satisfaction and help increase the frequency of their visits. We 
also hope that the process of checking out and viewing past purchases is useful.
We're also looking forward to receiving user feedback, which we plan to use to improve 
the app and add new features that customers want.
